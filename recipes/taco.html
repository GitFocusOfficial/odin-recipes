                    <h2>Taco Pasta Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>If you think you’ve seen it all, think again. This taco pasta recipe combines two foods that are widely loved — and the result is pretty close to perfection.</p>
                    <p>This recipe is so easy too. There are only three steps: cook your pasta, cook your taco mix, and combine your ingredients. It’s that simple. The noodle called for in this recipe is spaghetti, but you can really use whatever noodle is in your pantry.</p>
                    <p>To prepare the taco portion, add in your ground beef and onions to a skillet, and cook until the meat is brown and the onions are translucent. Toss in a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles, mushroom soup, tomatoes, water, taco seasoning and Velveeta and cook until well-combined. The cream of mushroom soup may sound like an ingredient out of left field for a recipe like this, but it packs a ton of flavor and helps round out the sauce.</p>
                    <p>To finish, add the pasta to the skillet and mix together. Shred more Cheddar cheese over the pasta, and voilà — here’s a recipe that is saucy, cheesy, and the best of both worlds. If you want to add more flavor, add beef or vegetable broth instead of water. Store this pasta in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>6 ounces spaghetti or other pasta</li>
                        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                        <li>&frac12; cup diced onion</li>
                        <li>1 (10.5 once) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
                        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO<sup>*</sup>TEL<sup>®</sup>)</li>
                        <li>&frac23; cup water</li>
                        <li>1 ounce taco seasoning</li>
                        <li>1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese (such as Velveeta<sup>®</sup>), cubed</li>
                        <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>

                    <h2>How to Make Taco Pasta Step-By-Step</h2>
                    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade taco pasta:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook ground beef and onions until meat is browned and onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mushroom soup, tomatoes, water, and taco seasoning. Cook until well combined. Add Velveeta and stir until melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Drain pasta and add to skillet. Top with Cheddar cheese, cover, and let stand until cheese has melted.</li>
