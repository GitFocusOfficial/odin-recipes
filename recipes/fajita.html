                    <h2>Fajita Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>This recipe is like it sounds: chicken fajitas dressed in penne pasta. But this recipe is far from just that. The chicken is made with an array of seasonings—chili powder, onion and garlic powder, cumin, salt, and oregano—while the sauce is a mixture of milk, chicken broth, and salsa. The cherry on top? It’s all made in one pot.</p>
                    <p>A green, red, and yellow pepper, sliced and cleaned of seeds as well as a generous ¼ cup of cilantro makes this a proper chicken fajita pasta. A large heap of Mexican cheese will help too, and if you want to add a little heat to your pasta, use medium or hot salsa.</p>
                    <p>How can you make this pasta creamier? Any milk in your fridge will do, but whole milk will likely help a little more. Adding in a little heavy cream is a great choice for a thicker, saucy consistency as well—just add less milk.</p>
                    <p>Penne is a common noodle that you can’t really mess up either. It catches the sauce on a creamy pasta, so for this recipe, it’s a great match. If all you have in your pantry is spaghetti or fettuccine or some other noodle, that will work too.</p>
                    <p>Pasta is not complicated. Sauces can be if they use a lot of ingredients, and if you are marinating and cooking meat, that can require your attention, but as long as you have your noodles, your sauces and seasonings, and your supporting characters—veggies or protein—you’re ready to cook.</p>

                    <h2>How to Make Fajita Step-By-Step</h2>
                    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade fajita:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine chili powder, cumin, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Mexican oregano in a small bowl for the seasoning blend. Season chicken with half of the seasoning; reserve remaining seasoning for later.</li>
                        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken strips and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>
                        <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pot. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1 cup chicken broth and salsa, scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
                        <li>Add milk and dry pasta to the pot and stir to combine. Add chicken and bell peppers on top and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a light simmer and cook, gently stirring every 4 to 5 minutes, until pasta is cooked through and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Try and keep noodles as submerged as possible while cooking. If the consistency becomes too thick, add a bit more chicken broth.</li>
                        <li>Season with remaining seasoning blend, to taste. Stir in Mexican cheese and combine until melted. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.</li>
                    </ol>
